## About the project
<p>This project uses GIS mapping to display buildings and paths within the campus, making navigation easy for students, teachers, and visitors. Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented for efficient path finding.</p>

<br />
<p><b>What it does?</b></p>
<p>Our platform provides a web app for administrators and a mobile app for end users. The web app, built with React, Tailwind, and Firebase, allows administrators to manage campus data. The mobile app, developed with Java and Firebase, helps users find the shortest paths between buildings and navigate the campus efficiently.</p>
